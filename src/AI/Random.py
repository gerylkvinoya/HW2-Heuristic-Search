#AIPlayer
#Description: The responsbility of this class is to interact with the game by
#deciding a valid move based on a given game state. This class has methods that
#will be implemented by students in Dr. Nuxoll's AI course.
#
#Variables:
#   playerId - The id of the player.
##

    #   inputPlayerId - The id to give the new player (int)
    #   cpy           - whether the player is a copy (when playing itself)
